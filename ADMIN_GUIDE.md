### **Creating New Users**

#### **Method 1: Web Interface (Recommended)**

1. **Login as Admin**
   - Navigate to your deployment URL
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Access the Admin Dashboard

2. **Navigate to User Management**
   ```
   Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Add New User
   ```

3. **Fill User Information**

#### **Method 2: API Creation (Bulk Operations)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# bulk_user_creation.sh

API_URL="https://your-domain.com"
ADMIN_JWT="your-admin-jwt-token"

# Function to create user
create_user() {
  local email=$1
  local name=$2
  local role=$3
  local tenant_id=${4:-1}
  
  curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_JWT" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"email\": \"$email\",
      \"name\": \"$name\",
      \"role\": \"$role\",
      \"tenant_id\": $tenant_id
    }" \
    "$API_URL/api/users"
}

# Create hospital staff
create_user "dr.smith@hospital.com" "Dr. Sarah Smith" "doctor" 1
create_user "therapist.jones@hospital.com" "Mike Jones, LCSW" "therapist" 1
create_user "nurse.wilson@hospital.com" "Lisa Wilson, RN" "educator" 1

# Create school district users
create_user "counselor@school.edu" "Jane Counselor" "therapist" 2
create_user "teacher@school.edu" "Bob Teacher" "educator" 2

# Create parent users
create_user "parent1@family.com" "Parent One" "parent" 1
create_user "parent2@family.com" "Parent Two" "parent" 1
```

#### **Method 3: CSV Bulk Import**

1. **Prepare CSV File** (`users_import.csv`):
```csv
email,name,role,tenant_id,organization
dr.smith@hospital.com,Dr. Sarah Smith,doctor,1,City Hospital
therapist.jones@hospital.com,Mike Jones LCSW,therapist,1,City Hospital
counselor@school.edu,Jane Counselor,therapist,2,School District
teacher@school.edu,Bob Teacher,educator,2,School District
parent1@family.com,Parent One,parent,1,Individual
```

2. **Use Import Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# import_users.sh

API_URL="https://your-domain.com"
ADMIN_JWT="your-admin-jwt-token"
CSV_FILE="users_import.csv"

# Skip header line and process each user
tail -n +2 "$CSV_FILE" | while IFS=, read -r email name role tenant_id organization; do
  echo "Creating user: $email"
  
  curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_JWT" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"email\": \"$email\",
      \"name\": \"$name\",
      \"role\": \"$role\",
      \"tenant_id\": $tenant_id,
      \"organization\": \"$organization\"
